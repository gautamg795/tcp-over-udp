## Packet

Packets were designed as a struct, `Packet`.  `Packet` has an embedded struct, `headers`, which contains all of the header info, including the ack number, sequence number, and bit fields for the `ack`, `syn`, and `fin` flags.

There is an additional struct, `PacketWrapper`, which helps the server keep track of additional details such as when the packet was sent, whether or not they were sent, and whether or not they were retransmitted.

There are five additional methods:
* `operator<<()`: Takes in an std::ostream os and a Packet& p, and writes the packet to the ostream.
* `get_isn()`: Generates a random sequence number in the range [0, SEQ_MAX].
* `add_seq()`: Adds the two parameters, and takes the modulo of the sum to ensure that the resulting sequence number is in the range [0, SEQ_MAX].
* `now()`: Returns the current time.
* `to_timeval()`: Takes in a std::chrono duration and converts it to a timeval.


## Client

The client takes in the `hostname` and `port number` from the command line.  We use `getaddrinfo()` to create and bind to the appropriate UDP socket.  At this point, we also set the initial timeout to 500ms.  In this case, since UDP is connectionless, `connect()` simply sets the default parameters for `send()` and `receive()`.

Upon successfully opening and binding to a socket, `establish_connection()` performs the handshake and receives the file if the connection was successfully established.

`establish_connection()` has three parameters: the socket to send/receive on and two unitialized `uint32_t` values - `ack_out` and `seq_out`.  We randomly generate the initial sequence number and use `setsockopt()` to set the timeout value.  We use `send()` to send the initial SYN packet and then use `recv()` to receive responses until we get the corresponding SYN-ACK.  Upon successfully receiving the SYN-ACK, we prepare and send the last ACK (the last part of the three-way handshake), and initialize `ack_out` and `seq_out` with their respective values after the handshake.

If `establish_connection()` is successful, we call `receive_file()` with three parameters: the socket and the ack/seq numbers that were initialized at the end of `establish_connection()`.  We use an `std::unordered_map packet_cache` to cache out-of-order packets and their sequence numbers.  We set the timeout value appropriately and then call `recv()` to get the next packet.  If its sequence number indicates that it was not the packet that we were expecting, we check to see if the packet is part of the current window.  If it is, we discard it.  Otherwise, we add the packet to `packet_cache`.  If the packet is the one that we were expecting, we write its data to the fstream.  We then iterate over `packet_cache` and write as many subsequent packets as we can to the file.  After each packet, we send an ack for the last received packet.  We then loop to get the next packet.  If at any time we get a FIN packet, we call `close_connection()` with the socket and the client's current `ack` and `seq` numbers.

In `close_connection()`, we prepare a packet with the client's current ack and seq numbers.  We send the FIN-ACK and wait up to `close_timeout` seconds for the corresponding ACK.

## Server

The server obtains the port number and filename from the command line. Just as the client does, `getaddrinfo()` is called to create and bind to a UDP socket for sending and receiving messages. Once a socket has been successfully opened and binded to, `establish_connection()` is called to complete the handshake between itself and the client and then sends the requested file over. For `establish_connection()`, two parameters are passed in (a socket and a uint32_t seq_out). The server chooses its own initial sequence number using get_isn() which is placed in the segment header. This indicates to the client that its SYN packet has been received and that the server agrees to establish a connection. This segment granting connection is the SYNACK. 

After receiving completing the handshake with the client, indicated by an acknowledgement that follows the SYNACK, the server can call `send_file()`, which takes in a socket, a requested file, and a seq number (set from establishing the connection). Now we loop and send packets under the condition that the congestion window that is being used is less than the total size of the congestion window and include in the header the sequence number for that set of packet data. Additionally, if the server does not receive an acknowledgement from the client for the packet it sends after a given timeout value, then it will retransmit the packet. The connection begins in slow start mode and changes modes based on congestion problems. If a timeout event occurs then the `ssthresh` (slow start threshold) is set to half the congestion window and the congestion window is set to the 1 `MSS` (max segment size). If the current mode is fast recovery and an ACK is received for a missing segment then simply increase the congestion window by the packet data size and retransmit. If the same occurs while in slow start then simply increase the congestion window by the transmitted packet size. Otherwise, if three duplicate acknowledgements are received, then the ssthresh is set to half of the congestion window when congestion occured, the congestion window to the ssthresh plus 3*MSS, and the current mode to fast recovery mode. If an ACK is received while in congestion avoidance mode then increase cwnd by MSS bytes (MSS/cwnd) for each ACK.

In `close_connection()`, when a client issues to close the connection, it issues a close command that sends a segment to the server process with flag bit in the segmentâ€™s header, the FIN bit, set to 1. In response, the server sends the client an acknowledgment segment and then its own shutdown segment, which has the FIN bit set to 1.
